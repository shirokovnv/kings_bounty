# King's bounty

## Description

The project was created for the purpose of studying Unity.

The game is based on the original 1990 game from **New World Computing.**

The main goal is to find a legendary artifact that has been lost on one of several continents.

Unlike the original, the game has a procedural generation.

Other mechanics basically repeat the original: exploring the world, turn-based battles, collecting and using magic spells and more.
